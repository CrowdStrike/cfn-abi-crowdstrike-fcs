## How frequently will CrowdStrike Horizon scan my environment for Configuration (IOM) assessment?

You may configure your settings to determine how often the assessments will occur. The default rate is 2 hours after the last successfull assessment. Optional intervals: 6 hours, 12 hours and 24 hours

## How frequently will CrowdStrike Horizon scan my environment for Behavioral (IOA) assessment?

IOA findings are not generated by scheduled scans, but instead are forwarded to CrowdStrike at the time of the event via EventBridge.  This means IOA findings will appear in your Falcon Horizon console in near-real time.

## Can I create custom policies with CrowdStrike Falcon Horizon?

You can create custom policies for misconfiguration detections in your cloud accounts in Horizon. By defining your own rules, you get more coverage with fine-tuned policies that meet your own security and compliance requirements.
