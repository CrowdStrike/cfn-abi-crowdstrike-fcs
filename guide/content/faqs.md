## How frequently will CrowdStrike Horizon scan my environment for Configuration (IOM) assessment?

You can configure your settings to determine the frequency of assessments. The default rate is two hours after the last successful assessment. Optional intervals are six, 12, and 24 hours.

## How frequently will CrowdStrike Horizon scan my environment for Behavioral (IOA) assessment?

Indicator of Attack (IOA) findings are not generated by scheduled scans, but instead are forwarded to CrowdStrike at the time of the event via EventBridge. IOA findings will appear in your Falcon Horizon console in near real time.

## Can I create custom policies with CrowdStrike Falcon Horizon?
