This [AWS Built-In](https://aws.amazon.com/builtin) (ABI) solution deploys CrowdStrike Falcon CSPM integrations for AWS Organizations on the AWS Cloud. It’s for IT administrators and security professionals who want to provide Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) across multiple AWS accounts.

Deploying this ABI solution doesn't guarantee an organization’s compliance with any laws, certifications, policies, or other regulations.

Avoid breaches and make sure your cloud security configuration meets industry security recommendations with the CrowdStrike platform, Falcon CSPM. Falcon CSPM monitors your cloud services to detect critical security issues, common configuration errors, and patterns of suspicious behavior. Use CSPM to triage findings and find recommended remediations to close the gaps and keep your cloud data secure.

Get started using Falcon CSPM by registering your cloud accounts. When registering, CrowdStrike is granted limited read-only access to your cloud account. When registering your ABI solution, all accounts in that organization are registered automatically.
