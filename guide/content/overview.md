It’s for <persona-1> and <persona-2> that want to provide Cloud Security Posture Management across multiple AWS accounts.

Deploying this ABI package does not guarantee an organization’s compliance with any laws, certifications, policies, or other regulations.

Avoid breaches and make sure your cloud security configuration meets industry security recommendations with the CrowdStrike Cloud Security Posture Management platform, Falcon CSPM. Falcon CSPM monitors your AWS, Azure, and GCP cloud services to detect critical security issues, common configuration errors, and patterns of suspicious behavior. Use CSPM to triage findings and find recommended remediations to close the gaps and keep your cloud data secure.

The first step in getting started using Falcon CSPM, is to register your cloud accounts with Falcon CSPM. When registering, Falcon CSPM is granted limited read-only access to your cloud account.  When you register using this solution, all accounts in that organization are registered automatically for Falcon CSPM.
